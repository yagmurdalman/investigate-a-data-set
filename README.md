Udacity - Project 2: Investigate a Data Set
===========================================
In this project, I analyze the no show appointments dataset and then communicate the findings about it.
First, I specify the research questions in the introduction part, then clean the data in data wrangling part,
finally I find answers to the questions in the Exploratory Data Analysis part.

The data set collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether
or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
-‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
- ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
- ‘No-show’ column says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
